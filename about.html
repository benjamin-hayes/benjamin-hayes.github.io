					About Me
				</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Ben Hayes, a 19 year old videographer determined to make engaging and creative videos. I'm currently a rising sophomore at Brown University, studying Computer Science and Economics. I'm originally from Cincinnati, OH, but have skipped around the country living in Sacremento, CA, Milwaukee, WI where I first got into videography, and most recently Oakland, CA.
				</p>
				<p>
					I first gained interest in videography through social media and Youtube, watching everything from sports edits to travel videos. Originally, I used a GoPro to make very simple videos with no major editing. From there, I began using other people's more professional stock video to create and develop my skills and abilities. Last year, I finally picked up my own camera so I could begin filming and producing my own content.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've created videos for various clients across multiple domains. However, most of my work has been through swimming, as most of my travel and time revolves around the sport. Prior to college, I made edits for travel meets including spring NCSAs, Sectional meets, and Summer Junior Nationals. At Brown University, I have made a variety of videos including hype videos, the Senior Day video, and videos for social media on Meet Days. Most recently, I made a series of 3 videos over the course of the 2019 Ivy League Championship Meet highlighting Brown's success. I've also been brought on to the Brown Men's and Women's Water Polo teams as a manager to make hype videos throughout their seasons. Other videos I've created have been for local musicians in the Milwaukee area as well as personal projects for fun.
